Badass: Making Users Awesome
============================

By Kathy Sierra

Prologue
--------

* Sustained bestsellers are recommended by people,
  either from friends and family or consumer reviews

* People like products that make them feel amazing
  (they can do things they couldn't do before)

* People are motivated by the bigger context, not the tool,
  so the tool should help them be better at the bigger context

* Tool should help increase the ability
  to pick up more from the environment
  because this ability is deeply rewarding

* Conclusion:
  Don't just make a better [X],
  make a better user of [X]

* Example:
  Don't just make a better camera,
  make a better photographer

Think Badass
------------

* Think about what happens after using the tool;
  how are users more powerful?

* Questions to think about:

  1. How can we help our user get more social media followers?
  2. How can we help our user get more comments on his posts and photos?
  3. How can we help our user get people talking about his personal brand?
  4. How can we help people learn what our user values?
  5. Define our users' mission statement
  6. Design a T-shirt that makes our user look good

* Think about how our users are out-performing the competitor's users
  at the bigger context

The User Journey
----------------

* Be careful with upgrades because change is painful
  when users have gained an ability with the tool,
  and the upgrade puts them back in the "Suck Zone"

* Don't let users get stuck at being OK with a tool;
  help them cross to the "Badass Zone"

* Users get stuck at being OK with a tool
  when they're afraid to experiment with it
  for fear of not getting good results

* If you only make entry-level tools,
  think about the subset of the bigger context you can enable

Science of Badass
-----------------

* We must be specific in defining what "better"
  (or being badass) means for the bigger context

* Template: Given a [representative task in the domain],
  an expert [performs in a superior way] more reliably

* Example (for context): Given a [specific camera/lens and
  a specific exposure and composition setting],
  a badass [photographer produces more aesthetically
  pleasing and evocative photos] more reliably

* Example (for tool): Given a [specific requirement
  for exposure, focus, and color balance],
  a badass [user of this camera makes the correct
  adjustments in the optimal way] more reliably

Building Skills
---------------

* Experts build expertise by always adding new skills
  and by consciously practicing a skill that was automatic

* Best way to gain skills is through "deliberate practice,"
  which means practicing (and becoming reliable) one thing at a time

* Practice excercises should have the user
  perform a task from unreliable to 95% reliability
  in one to three 45-90 minute sessions

Perceptual Exposure
-------------------

* Experts are exposed to high quantity
  and high quality examples of expertise

* With many and diverse examples,
  the brain learns the pattern subconsciously
  (perceptual knowledge)

* Therefore, expose users to a high quantity
  of high quality examples, within a short time,
  and with feedback (what is good or bad)

Remove Blocks
-------------

* Help users move forward (continue to be motivated),
  focus on reducing what slows or stops them

* Two big "gaps" that derail users:
  Gap of Suck (it's painful to learn) and
  Gap of Disconnect (no connection between tool and context)

* We can't be there to notice users' frustration,
  but we can help them by telling them
  that it's normal to struggle at the start

* Be on the safe side, and act as if users will be frustrated,
  so acknowledge it in as many places as possible

Progress + Payoffs
------------------

* Help users stay motivated by
  (1) telling them where they are at each step to greatness and
  (2) giving them ideas and tools to help them use their current skills

* Create a path by making a list of key skills
  ordered from beginning to expert,
  then categorize them into groups to make ranks or levels;
  each new level should be harder to attain than the previous

* Help users do something meaningful quickly
  (think: what's an early small step that feels like a superpower?)

* Design tools to help them experiment with the product
  (like a "reset" button to put things back as they were)

* Continue to design the path with "superpower" payoffs each step

* Payoffs include high-resolution experiences and flow,
  and meaningful domain-specific jargon

* Create a web page, PDF, or video of tips and tricks
  to help them get the high payoffs

Design and Reduce Cognitive Leaks
---------------------------------

* Reduce cognitive leaks (uncertainty about whether an action
  the user did was exactly what was intended)

* Reduce having the user to remember things;
  tools should have their controls labeled

* But if memorizing some things is important for the bigger context,
  tell users which facts and when they should memorize them

* For every action users need to take
  (and for any new feature being considered),
  ask: What's the most likely thing to do here?

* Reduce choices: be the expert, mentor, guide,
  and suggest what they should choose
  
* Help users automate their skills

* Help users practice by designing (or recommending)
  a practice notebook and tracking app

* Help them build automatic habits
  (e.g., charging batteries, importing photos to computer)

Escape the Brain's Spam Filter
------------------------------

* Having examples, pictures, or stories
  that are captivating and useful helps users remember

* Use "Why? So what? Who cares" to interest users
  (e.g., in a user manual)

* Reduce the content that the brain must pay attention to

* The best time to show them knowledge
  is when they absolutely need it
  (or convince them that facts now are important for later)
